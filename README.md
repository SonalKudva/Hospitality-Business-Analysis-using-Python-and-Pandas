Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation

Cleaned and analyzed 5+ CSV datasets containing booking, hotel, and room data to understand occupancy trends and revenue performance.

Applied data wrangling techniques to handle missing values, detect outliers (via standard deviation method), and correct invalid entries like negative guest counts.

Created new calculated metrics such as occupancy percentage (OCC%), and derived business-critical KPIs using groupby, merge, and apply functions.

Generated month-wise and city-wise insights on revenue realized and room occupancy, helping identify high-performing room types (e.g., Presidential Suites) and cities.

Visualized booking trends using bar plots, enabling comparison across room classes, day types (weekday/weekend), and months (e.g., June, August).

Automated month-wise aggregation of realized revenue and appended new data (August) to historical datasets using concat() for scalable reporting.
